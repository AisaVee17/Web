        <h2>The Story of Laoag City</h2>
        <p>Long before Spanish colonization, the region now comprising Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, and La Union was renowned for its gold mines and was called <i>samtoy</i> by its Austronesian inhabitants. Traders from Japan and China frequently visited to exchange gold for ceramics, beads, and silk.</p>
        <p>In 1572, Juan de Salcedo led a Spanish expedition north, landing in Vigan and exploring areas like Laoag and Currimao. Impressed by the sheltered coves (<i>looc</i>), the Spaniards named the region "Ylocos" and its people "Ylocanos." With Christianization, the Spanish built churches and bell towers, but abuses by friars led to notable revolts, including those led by Diego and Gabriela Silang and the Basi Revolt of 1807.</p>
        <p>By 1818, population growth and unrest prompted the division of Ilocos into Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur, with Laoag as Ilocos Norte's capital. It became a city in 1965, with Eulalio F. Siazon as its first mayor.</p>
